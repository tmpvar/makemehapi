Create a Hapi server which responds to GET requests to `/` by streaming a ROT13'd version of a file that contains:

```
The Pursuit of Hapi-ness
```

Output should look like:

```
Gur Chefhvg bs Uncv-arff
```

based on the query string `?string=The Pursuit of Hapi-ness`

-----------------------------------------------------------------
##HINTS

### Stream

The Hapi handler `reply` function can accept a stream as an argument.

### File

The `fs` module has a `createReadStream(pathToFile)` function that would be useful.

### Simple ROT13

Use sample code from `https://gist.github.com/thegoleffect/df70f2102f1b2e794550`.
